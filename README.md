## Overview of the project:
### Project Overview: Java File Operations

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to demonstrate basic file handling in Java, including:
##### **=>** Writing content to a text file
##### **=>** Reading content from a text file
##### **=>** Modifying the content of a text file (word replacement)
This simple project helps in understanding Java's I/O (Input/Output) operations using standard libraries like java.io and java.nio.file.

### Key Activities:
##### **1.** Writing to a File
##### **=>** Uses BufferedWriter and FileWriter to create or overwrite a text file.
##### **=>** Adds user-defined content to the file.
##### **2.** Reading from a File
##### **=>** Uses BufferedReader and FileReader to read and print file contents line by line.
##### **3.** Modifying File Content
##### **=>** Reads the full file content as a string using Files.readString().
##### **=>** Replaces a specific word (oldWord) with another (newWord) using String.replaceAll().
##### **=>** Writes the modified content back using Files.writeString().

### Technologies Used:
##### **Java (JDK 8+):** Core language for implementation
##### **java.io.*:** For file reading/writing using streams
##### **java.nio.file.*:** For modern file I/O operations with Paths/Files
##### **BufferedReader/Writer:** Efficient file I/O
##### **FileReader/Writer:** Basic character stream readers/writers

### Conclusion:
This project effectively showcases how to perform common file operations in Java. It covers:
##### **=>** File creation and writing
##### **=>** Reading from a file
##### **=>** Text manipulation within files
